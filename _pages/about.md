Research Interests
======
My research is centered on the integration of artificial intelligence with molecular biology. Specifically, I focus on the study of RNA-pritein interaction, noncoding RNA and precision medicine like T cell therapy. My objective is to leverage the power of AI to better understand these complex biological phenomena and to develop innovative, tailored therapeutics for disease treatment.
